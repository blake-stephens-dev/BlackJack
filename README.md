Blackjack (Rust CLI)

A simple command-line Blackjack game written in Rust.
This project demonstrates basic state management, structs/enums, and modular program design — all within a terminal-based card game simulation.

Overview

This is a lightweight and educational implementation of the classic casino game Blackjack (21).
Players are automatically dealt cards and make decisions based on basic rules.
While it follows the core logic of Blackjack, it’s not a 100% accurate simulation — some rule variations and features (like betting, splits, or insurance) are intentionally omitted for simplicity.
